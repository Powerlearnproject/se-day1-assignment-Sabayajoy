# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
 .Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles , methods and tools to develop and maintain  high quality software systems.
           . Importance
 . Enables creation of software application that power various aspeacts of life such as communication , trade and healthcare

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
 .developement of programing languages
 .establishment of software engineering as a discpline
 .advent of structured programming
 . Rise of agile methodology

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
 .Requirements- identfying and documenting user needs and system requirements 
 .Design - creating a detailed software architecture and user interface
 .implementation - writing code and buliding software according to the  design specifications
 .testing - conducting different test to ensure the software meets quality standard and functional requirements
 .deployment - releasing software to users
 .Maintainance - providing ongoing support ,updates and enhancements to the software after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  .Waterfall - uses a sequential approach for examples projects that are highly regulated
  .Agile - uses an iteractive and incremental approch for example projects that require innovative solutions

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineerig team
  . Software Developer -
  writing code 
  implementing software solutions.
  . Quality Assurance Engineer-
  Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
.Project Manager-
Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
     importance
 Enhance productivity, collaboration, and code quality.
 .Intergrated Development Enviroments - Visual studio
 .Version Control Systems - Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges. .Tight Deadlines'
  .Challenges
    .Changing requirements
    .Tight deadline
    .Techincal Debt
 Strategies
   .Effective Communication
   .priotization of task
   .regular reaassement of project goals and timelines
   . agile methodlogyy
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  . Unit Testing- Testing individual components or modules of software
  . Integration Testing- Testing interactions between different components 
  . System Testing -Testing the entire software system as a whole
  . Acceptance Testing- Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs
    Importance
.Helps in identifying and fixing of defects leading to high quality software

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models. 
Prompt Engineering is the crafting of questions or statement to get the best reponse from AI
  Importance 
.makes the question clear and specific so that the AI understants what you want

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
